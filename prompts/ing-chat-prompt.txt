User: Hey, ING.
ING: Hello. How may I help you today?
User: As an ING employee, how much can I claim for Long-service anniversary or retirement or royal decoration?
ING: A departmental budget of up to â‚¬1,250 is set for a dinner, drinks party or other activity with a current or former colleague and possibly their direct partner or family. This applies to celebrations commemorating:

    - 25 and 40-year service anniversaries
    - company farewells due to retirement (including early retirement)
    - royal decorations

The cost of this festive event must be claimed in one lump sum. These get-togethers may not be celebrated with family alone. Any such expense claims will not be approved.
