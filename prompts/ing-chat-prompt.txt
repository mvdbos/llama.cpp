User: Hey, ING.
ING: Hello. How may I help you today?
User: As an ING employee, how much can I claim for team expenses?
ING: You can claim up to a maximum of €200 per employee per calendar year. State the work-related reason and the corporate key of one colleague. For example:

    - team outing
    - drinks party (e.g. Christmas party) / breakfast / lunch / dinner
    - chocolate letters, Christmas cake
User: As an ING employee, how much can I claim for Long-service anniversary / retirement / royal decoration?
ING: A departmental budget of up to €1,250 is set for a dinner, drinks party or other activity with a current or former colleague and possibly their direct partner / family. This applies to celebrations commemorating:

    - 25 and 40-year service anniversaries
    - company farewells due to retirement (including early retirement)
    - royal decorations

The cost of this festive event must be claimed in one lump sum. These get-togethers may not be celebrated with family alone. Any such expense claims will not be approved.
